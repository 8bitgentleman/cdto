Finder Toolbar app to open the current directory in the Terminal.

 * It's written in objective-c, and uses the scripting bridge so it's *fast*.
 * It's also shell agnostic. Works equally well when your shell is `bash` or `fish` or `zsh`.
 * **NEW**: Enhanced theme support - automatically uses your Terminal default profile
 * **NEW**: Improved single window behavior with smart auto-close detection

### Usage:

Download [Latest cdto.zip](https://github.com/jbtule/cdto/releases/latest)

To install "cd to ....app" copy to your Applications folder, and then from the applications folder âŒ˜ drag it into the Finder toolbar or drag from another finder window to toolbar being customized.

To use, just click on the new button and instantly opens a new terminal window.

### What's New:

**Enhanced Theme Support**
- Automatically detects and uses your Terminal default profile
- No manual configuration needed - just works with your existing preferences
- Reliable theme application with proper timing

**Improved Window Management**
- Fixed double Terminal window opening issue
- Smart auto-close detection that preserves windows with actual work
- Better handling of various Terminal startup states

**Maintained Benefits**
- Still fast (pure Objective-C with ScriptingBridge)
- Still shell agnostic (works with bash, zsh, fish, etc.)
- Fully backward compatible with existing settings

### Settings

**Enhanced Auto-Close (Recommended)**

To turn on the improved auto-close feature that intelligently closes unused Terminal windows:

```bash
defaults write name.tuley.jay.cd-to cdto-close-default-window -bool true
```

**Custom Profile Override (Optional)**

By default, cdto automatically uses your Terminal default profile. To override with a specific profile:

```bash
# Use a specific profile
defaults write name.tuley.jay.cd-to cdto-new-window-setting -string "Pro"

# Reset to automatic detection
defaults delete name.tuley.jay.cd-to cdto-new-window-setting
```
